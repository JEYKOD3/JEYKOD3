## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

My name is Jean Emmanuel Yao, and I'm currently a 4th-year software engineering student at ETS. Alongside my studies, I'm passionate about fitness and work as an online personal trainer. I use Trainerize as my main platform to manage my clients' programs.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a web app to reach a bigger community and help more people on their fitness journey. My goal is to create a platform that makes fitness coaching more accessible and effective for everyone.

ðŸŒ± I'm always eager to learn and grow, both in my engineering skills and my fitness expertise.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on fitness software development projects. If you're interested in combining technology and fitness, let's connect!

âš¡ Fun fact: Additionally, I'm passionate about space exploration.

Feel free to explore my repositories and get in touch if you have any questions or collaboration ideas!
